// this stores:
// the title/payee
// the amount, positive or negative
// the account it's pulling from
// the category it's pulling from
// the first two are really easy, very similar to categories and accounts
// but the last two are a little more tricky
// you need to store some sort of connection to the category and account
// and then you have to grab it and change the balance accordingly
// i was just using indexes (numbers)
// but that's a trash idea bc like they could change at any time when something is deleted
// so i need a new strat
// maybe store the date of the category and acc
// then pull it from the list
